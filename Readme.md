FlowLauncher.DropboxFinder is plugin for Flow Launcher to search files directly within Dropbox, this makes finding files super easy from the launcher directly, I've found this super helpful when I compare the results to Windows search gets me in terms of results, especially when you have Dropbox on online only, since the Windows indexer will not find the files on the local machine.

### Usage

    df <name of the file you're looking for>
    
    
### Fast testing

I have written a quick testing utility named debug.ps1 to easy test my changes but closing Flow Launcher and loading the plugin automatically during development.
